# Code Genie

Legacy tools modernization efforts are slowed by the difficulty of understanding legacy code and disconnected documentation. A solution is needed to dynamically explain code and link it with systems like Jira and Git for faster, informed modernization.


## Key Features of Code Genie

### Multi-Language Support  
**Broad compatibility for legacy and modern codebases**  
- Supports: **Python**, **C**, **C++**, **COBOL**, **Fortran**, **C#**  
- Analyze heterogeneous systems without switching tools or environments

---

### Intuitive Upload & Live Preview  
**Fast onboarding with real-time code visibility**  
- Drag-and-drop or browse files (up to **200 MB** each)  
- Instant preview with syntax highlighting and file navigation  
- Helps teams quickly inspect code before analysis begins

---

### Clear Explanations  
**Human-readable walkthroughs of code behavior**  
- Describes **functions, loops, conditionals**, and **data flows** in plain English  
- Automatically highlights **key logic paths** and **cross-file dependencies**  
- Ideal for onboarding, audits, or working with undocumented code

---

### Complexity Analysis  
**Objective insights into code maintainability**  
- Rates code on a **1–10 complexity scale**  
- Provides **visual complexity charts** for fast at-a-glance diagnostics  
- Helps prioritize high-risk, hard-to-maintain code

---

### Vulnerability Detection  
**Built-in safety and risk analysis**  
- Detects **missing exception handling**, **unsafe access**, and **permission gaps**  
- Flags **crash-prone logic**, **unhandled edge cases**, and **security blind spots**  
- Critical for secure modernization and system hardening

---

### Linting & Style Suggestions  
**Make code cleaner and more readable**  
- Auto-applies **PEP 8** (for Python) and other language-specific formatting standards  
- Identifies **naming issues**, **spacing errors**, and **inconsistent syntax**  
- Improves team readability and reduces technical debt

---

### Auto Change Summary  
**Clear, concise refactoring highlights**  
- Generates a **“Key Changes” diff** for each file  
- Summarizes significant modifications in natural language  
- Great for **peer review**, **approvals**, and **change tracking**

---

### Exportable Reports  
**Automation and documentation-ready output**  
- Download **structured JSON** for integration with CI/CD and dashboards  
- Export **professional PDFs** for stakeholders or audits  
- Choose between single-file or batch export modes
